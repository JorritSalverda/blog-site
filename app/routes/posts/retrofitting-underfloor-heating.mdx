## Introduction

Before we moved into our new house it was still outfitted with gas fired central heating and wall-mounted radiators. In order to be able to wean ourselves off of fossil fuel for heating, tap water and cooking in the future we knew it was best to use underfloor heating. It can keep your house warm at much lower temperatures, making it a better fit for a heatpump.

# Retrofit

Unfortunately the 9 year old house didn't have underfloor heating on any of the levels. It's pretty common these days to have at least underfloor heating on the ground level. For the other levels it's less common. We did choose to do it for all levels though because it makes it possible to no just heat those rooms, but also to cool them during summer.

A retrofit being very disruptive made us do this before we moved into the house. All floors have to be removed and then an underfloor heating milling machines mails tracks into the underfloor spaced 10cm apart in a very attractive pattern.
