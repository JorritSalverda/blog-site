  title: Underfloor heating
  intro: To prepare our house for going full-electric at some point in the future we installed underfloor heating in retrofit on all levels.

Before we moved into our new house it was still outfitted with gas fired central heating and wall-mounted radiators. In order to be able to wean ourselves off of fossil fuel for heating, tap water and cooking in the future we knew it was best to use underfloor heating. It can keep your house warm at much lower temperatures, making it a better fit for a heatpump.

## Milling

Unfortunately the 9 year old house didn't have underfloor heating on any of the levels. It's pretty common these days to have at least underfloor heating on the ground level. For the other levels it's less common. We did choose to do it for all levels though because it makes it possible to no just heat those rooms, but also to cool them during summer.

Since taking apart the floors is very disruptive we had this work done before we moved into the house. All existing floors first have to be removed, then an underfloor heating milling machines mills tracks into the underfloor. They are spaced 10 cm apart in a pretty attractive pattern as you can see below.

## Distributors

To get warm water into the underfloor heating you need a distributor on each level. The size of the distributor depends on the number of loops present in the floor. Then there's 2 types of distributors, _open_ and _closed_ ones. The _open_ distributor has a pump of itself to ensure that a high temperature source can be used without risking overheating the floors. It essentially mixes just the amount of hot water with what's already in the loop to keep the temperature below the maximum allowed temperature (usually 40° Celsius) in order to prevent damage to your floors.

When you use a low temperature source like a heatpump you use a _closed_ distributor which doesn't have a pump of its own and just relies on the temperature of the incoming water to be within limits. Although we asked for distributors to be prepared in light of a future heatpump we still got _open_ distributors installed. This could have probably been avoided by just lowering the output temperature of the central heater to 40° Celsius. We did that anyway to save gas.

## Floors

To make the use of underfloor heating efficient you need to pay close attention to the thermal conductivity of the type of floor. For wood this means you better not use a solid wood floor, but a special laminated wooden floor with a higher thermal conductivity. In our case we choose a floor consisting of 10 mm of laminated layers with 2 mm of oak on top for the ground level.

On the other levels we choose a polyurethane floor, which has even better thermal conductivity.
