## Introduction

Before we moved into our new house it was still outfitted with gas fired central heating and wall-mounted radiators. In order to be able to wean ourselves off of fossil fuel for heating, tap water and cooking in the future we knew it was best to use underfloor heating. It can keep your house warm at much lower temperatures, making it a better fit for a heatpump.

## Installation

Unfortunately the 9 year old house didn't have underfloor heating on any of the levels. It's pretty common these days to have at least underfloor heating on the ground level. For the other levels it's less common. We did choose to do it for all levels though because it makes it possible to no just heat those rooms, but also to cool them during summer.

With the installation process being very disruptive we had this work done before we moved into the house. All existing floors first have to be removed, then an underfloor heating milling machines mills tracks into the underfloor. They are spaced 10cm apart in a pretty attractive pattern.
